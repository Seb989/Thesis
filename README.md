Welcome to the Github repository for our thesis in economics at Copenhagen University.

The thesis is investigating the effect of generic competition on the price and quantity dynamics in the US outpatient prescription drug market by utilizing an event study approach. All the code is available at the repository to ensure transparency.

To provide an understanding of our approach, the purpose of the different files are described in chronological order:
1. _code_for_medicaid_data_: Fetching and aggregating price and quantity data from Medicaid's API.
2. _code_for_openFDA_NDC_data_: Extracting general drug data (information about active ingredient, strength, and more) from openFDA (downloaded file).
3. _code_for_nih_: Extracting ATC data from the National Library of Medicine's API.
4. _code_for_consolidation_data_: Clearing, filtering, and merging the data.
5. _code_for_regression_: Transforming the data.
6. _code_for_descriptive_stat_: Creating descriptive figures and tables.
7. _data_reg.dta_: Estimating our regression models.

NB: Reservations are made for any errors in the code.
